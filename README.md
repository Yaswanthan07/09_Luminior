# 🦯✨ BlindSafe 360  
### A Zero-Internet Smart Mobility System for the Visually Impaired

> **Silent. Smart. Secure. Independent Mobility.**

---

## 🌍 Introduction

BlindSafe 360 is a next-generation assistive smart mobility system designed to empower visually impaired individuals with **safe, independent, and confident navigation**. Unlike traditional assistive tools that focus only on ground-level obstacles or rely on audio feedback and internet connectivity, BlindSafe 360 provides **silent, real-time, 360° environmental awareness** using intelligent sensing and haptic communication.

The system detects obstacles at **three critical spatial levels — floor, body, and head** — and conveys this information through an intuitive **haptic language**, enabling users to understand their surroundings without sound, screens, or network dependency.

BlindSafe 360 is **wearable, modular, affordable, and offline-first**, making it suitable for everyday use in urban and rural environments alike.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Visually impaired individuals face daily challenges while navigating environments due to:
- ❌ Limited awareness of head- and body-level obstacles
- ❌ Over-reliance on audio feedback that causes cognitive overload
- ❌ Assistive devices requiring constant internet connectivity
- ❌ Lack of reliable emergency support in network-deprived areas

Existing solutions fail to provide **holistic spatial awareness**, **silent feedback**, and **offline reliability** — creating a significant gap in assistive mobility technology.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

BlindSafe 360 introduces a **multi-module wearable system** that:
- Detects obstacles at **floor, body, and head levels**
- Communicates hazards using **directional vibration patterns**
- Works **completely offline**
- Provides a **zero-internet emergency SOS system**

The solution consists of:
- 🕶️ **Smart Glasses** for head-level detection
- 🦺 **Haptic Belt** for body-level awareness and coordination
- 🦿 **Shin Module** for floor-level hazard detection

## 🧠 Key Features

### 🔍 Multi-Level Obstacle Detection
- 🦶 **Floor Level**: Steps, potholes, curbs, uneven surfaces  
- 🧍 **Body Level**: Walls, people, vehicles  
- 🧠 **Head Level**: Hanging objects, signboards, tree branches  

---

### 📳 Intelligent Haptic Language
BlindSafe 360 replaces audio alerts with intuitive vibration patterns:

| Vibration Pattern | Meaning |
|------------------|---------|
| 🔵 Pulse–Pause | Obstacle detected at safe distance |
| 🔴 Continuous Fast Vibration | Immediate danger |
| ➡️ Directional Sweep | Safe path guidance |
| 🦶 Ankle Vibration | Floor-level hazard |
| 🎽 Belt Vibration | Body-level obstacle |
| 🕶️ Temple Vibration | Head-level obstacle |

This minimizes cognitive load and enhances spatial understanding.

### 🆘 Zero-Internet Emergency SOS
- 🚑 **IMU-based fall detection**
- 📡 **LoRa-based local mesh communication**
- 📍 GPS location sharing
- 🌐 Optional cloud automation (if internet is available)
- 🤝 Community-based safety network

Ensures help reaches the user **even without internet connectivity**.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

🔹 **ESP32 as the central brain**  
🔹 Local communication via **ESP-NOW**  
🔹 Emergency alerts via **LoRa (SX1278)**  
🔹 Modular design with independent power sources  

The system intelligently prioritizes sensor data and delivers precise haptic feedback in real time.
