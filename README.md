### A Zero-Internet Smart Mobility System for the Visually Impaired

BlindSafe 360 is an assistive smart mobility system designed to improve the safety, independence, and confidence of visually impaired individuals during everyday navigation. Unlike conventional assistive tools that primarily detect ground-level obstacles or depend heavily on audio feedback and internet connectivity, BlindSafe 360 delivers **silent, real-time, 360° spatial awareness** through an innovative multi-level sensing and haptic communication approach.

The system identifies obstacles at **three critical levels — floor, body, and head** — and communicates this information using a well-defined **haptic language**. By replacing audio alerts with intuitive vibration patterns, BlindSafe 360 significantly reduces cognitive load and allows users to remain aware of their surrounding environment without social discomfort or distraction.

Designed as a **wearable, modular, and offline-first solution**, BlindSafe 360 integrates smart glasses, a haptic belt, and a shin-mounted module to provide comprehensive environmental awareness. Additionally, the system incorporates a **zero-internet emergency SOS mechanism** using LoRa-based local mesh communication, ensuring reliable assistance even in remote or network-deprived areas.

By focusing on accessibility, affordability, privacy, and reliability, BlindSafe 360 bridges critical gaps in existing assistive technologies and takes a step toward enabling **truly independent mobility** for the visually impaired.
